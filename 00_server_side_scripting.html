	<h1>Server Side Scripting</h1>
	<p>Servers are responsible for hosting the web sites and applications on the internet. Clients (users/browsers) make requests of servers (eg: "Show me www.bcit.ca"). Servers provide responses to clients (eg: "Here's the HTML, CSS, Javascript and images required to display BCIT's homepage"). It is the client's job to render (display) the server response.</p>
	<p>An HTTP server can be enabled to process various scripting languages, providing the web developer with various capabilities:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>form processing</li>
		<li>dynamic content</li>
		<li>cookie management</li>
		<li>session handling</li>
		<li>file processing</li>
		<li>database interactivity</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>PHP</h2>
<ul>
			<li>originally called "Personal Home Page" tools</li>
			<li>created by Rasmus Lerdorf, and released in June 1995</li>
			<li>now more commonly known as the "PHP Hypertext Preprocessor"</li>
			<li>you can configure your web server to identify HTTP requests that contain PHP</li>
			<li>an interpreter processes the PHP Scripts, passes results back to Client</li>
			<li>whereas Perl is a standalone Scripting Language (i.e., separate Perl programs are created), PHP is a server-side scripting language that can be embedded right in your HTML</li>
			<li>syntax takes inspiration from several popular languages - bits of C, Java and Perl - and adds some unique PHP things for good measure</li>
			<li>"The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly." (<a href="http://www.php.net/">http://www.php.net/</a>)</li>
			<li><strong>advantages:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li> easy to implement, easy to learn, and easy to use</li>
				<li> runs on almost any web server on almost any platform currently available</li>
				<li> open source / free</li>
				<li> optimized for efficient MySQL database transactions</li>
				<li> enjoys high saturation in modern web applications</li>
			</ul></li>
